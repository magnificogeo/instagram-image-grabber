instagram-image-grabber
=======================

A fun idea of searching for images at a particular location on instagram. It was a quick and dirty solo hack done during Angelhack San Francisco Spring 2013.

I built this simple script using google maps api and instagram. You can drag the cursor around to see what are the photos taken at a particular geographical area.

6 Mar 2014 - It's been almost a year since I built this script. Some of the gmaps api endpoints have deprecated. I have yet to find the time to fix it.
